/**
 * Known defects, each with the test that must notice it.
 *
 * Codex, chunk 0 round 3: "that each fix carries a test which fails without the
 * fix" was sitting in the list of things the gate cannot decide, and that was
 * dishonest — mutation testing decides it mechanically. A claim parked where it
 * can never fail is how exit 0 gets bought instead of earned.
 *
 * They live in their OWN file for a measured reason. When these entries sat
 * inside acceptance-gate.mjs, the anchor text appeared twice in that file: once
 * in the real code and once quoted here as data. The mutation replaced the
 * quotation, the code was never touched, the test passed, and the mutation was
 * reported as surviving. A mutation that edits its own description proves
 * nothing. The gate now also refuses any anchor that is not unique.
